# battleship-simulation

Rules of the Game

● Battleship is a game played between 2 players.

● Each player will be initialised with an M * M grid with ’S’ number of ships
placed at specified positions on the grid.

● One battleship occupies a single position on the grid.

● It takes a single shot to bring down the battleship of an opponent.

● The objective of the game is to destroy the opponent's battleships. Each player will be
given ’T’ number of missiles to bring down the fleet of opposition. The player who does
the most damage/brings down the ships of the opposition wins

● This will be a simulation of an actual battle wherein each player's actions are given as an
input to the program.

● Based on hits / misses of a missile on the opponent, either of the players might be
victorious or the game might end as a draw

INPUT

The input for the game will be read from a file which contains the following (numbers below
represent line numbers in input file)

1. Contains the size of the battleground ‘M’
   ○ (0 < M < 10 )
2. Contains the number of ships ’S’ which can be placed on the M*M grid
   ○ ( 0 < S <= M^2/2)
3. Player 1 ship positions in the grid, position represented by x1,y1:x2,y2 and so on
4. Player 2 ship positions, they are placed in the grid with the same format as above
5. Tells the total number of missiles players have
   ○ (0 < T < 100)
6. Player 1 missile targets, represented by x1,y1:x2,y2 and so on
7. Player 2 missile targets, represented with the same format as above
   A Player's moves will be a colon separated list of target positions (x, y) of missile attacks on the
   enemy grid.

Note: All the missiles will be shot at the same time for both the players and corresponding ships
will be destroyed at the same time as well.

Inputs

1. M i.e GridSize [Matrix of M*M]
2. S i.e TotalShips
   P1 Ship Positions: 1,1:2,0:2,3:3,4,... (x,y pairs separated by colon)
3. P2 Ship Positions: 0,1:2,0:2,3:3,4,...
4. T i.e TotalMissiles
5. P1 missile targets: 1,1:2,0... (x,y pairs of length ’T’)
6. P2 missile targets: 1,2:3,0... (x,y pairs of length ‘T’)

OUTPUT

Output should be written to a file that should contain the following information:

● Player 1 and Player 2 grids after the battleship simulation.

● Alive Battleships denoted with “B”

● Dead Battleships with “X” (if missile hit the battleship) HIT

● Missile Missed Locations “O” (if the missile location didn’t have a ship) MISS

● Final result:

○ P1:total hits

○ P2:total hits

● Game Result

Game Result

● "Player 1 wins”, if player 1 does most damage to player 2’s ships

● "Player 2 wins”, if player 2 does most damage to player 1’s ships

● "It is a draw”, if both players inflict the same damage
